  ///
  /// - [startTime]: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). The oldest UTC

  ///
  /// - [sinceTweetId]: Returns results with a Tweet ID greater than (that is,

  /// The full-archive Tweet counts endpoint returns the count of Tweets that
  /// match your query from the complete history of public Tweets;
  /// since the first Tweet was created March 26, 2006.
  ///
  /// ## Parameters
  ///
  /// - [query]: One query for matching Tweets.
  ///            You can learn how to build this query by reading a [build a query guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/counts/integrate/build-a-query).
  ///            You can use all available operators and can make queries
  ///            up to 1,024 characters long.
  ///
  /// - [nextToken]: This parameter is used to get the next 'page' of results.
  ///                The value used with the parameter is pulled directly from
  ///                the response provided by the API, assuming that your
  ///                request contains more than 31 days-worth of results, and
  ///                should not be modified. You can learn more by visiting our page on [pagination](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/pagination).
  ///
  /// - [startTime]: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). The oldest UTC
  ///                timestamp from which the Tweets will be provided. Timestamp
  ///                is in second granularity and is inclusive (for example,
  ///                12:00:01 includes the first second of the minute). By
  ///                default, a request will return Tweets from up to 30 days
  ///                ago if you do not include this parameter.
  ///
  /// - [endTime]: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). Used with
  ///              `startTime`. The newest, most recent UTC timestamp to which
  ///              the Tweets will be provided. Timestamp is in second
  ///              granularity and is exclusive (for example, 12:00:01 excludes
  ///              the first second of the minute). If used without `startTime`,
  ///              Tweets from 30 days before `endTime` will be returned by
  ///              default. If not specified, `endTime` will default to
  ///              [now - 30 seconds].
  ///
  /// - [sinceTweetId]: Returns results with a Tweet ID greater than (that is,
  ///                   more recent than) the specified ID. The ID specified is
  ///                   exclusive and responses will not include it. If included
  ///                   with the same request as a [startTime] parameter, only
  ///                   [sinceTweetId] will be used.
  ///
  /// - [untilTweetId]: Returns results with a Tweet ID less than
  ///                   (that is, older than) the specified ID. Used with
  ///                   [sinceTweetId]. The ID specified is exclusive and
  ///                   responses will not include it.
  ///
  /// - [granularity]: This is the granularity that you want the time series
  ///                  count data to be grouped by. You can request
  ///                  `minute`, `hour`, or `day` granularity. The default
  ///                  granularity, if not specified is `hour`.

  ///
  /// The Tweets returned by this endpoint count towards the Project-level Tweet
  /// cap.
  ///
  /// ## Parameters
  ///
  /// - [userId]: Unique identifier of the Twitter account (user ID) for whom
  ///             to return results. User ID can be referenced using
  ///             the `user/lookup` endpoint. More information on Twitter IDs is
  ///             [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-ids).
  ///
  /// - [maxResults]: Specifies the number of Tweets to try and retrieve, up to
  ///                 a maximum of 100 per distinct request. By default,
  ///                 10 results are returned if this parameter is not supplied.
  ///                 The minimum permitted value is 5. It is possible to
  ///                 receive less than the `max_results` per request throughout
  ///                 the pagination process.
  ///
  /// - [paginationToken]: This parameter is used to move forwards or backwards
  ///                      through 'pages' of results, based on the value of
  ///                      the `next_token` or `previous_token` in the response.
  ///                      The value used with the parameter is pulled directly
  ///                      from the response provided by the API, and should
  ///                      not be modified.
  ///
  /// - [startTime]: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). The oldest UTC
  ///                timestamp from which the Tweets will be provided. Timestamp
  ///                is in second granularity and is inclusive (for example,
  ///                12:00:01 includes the first second of the minute). By
  ///                default, a request will return Tweets from up to 30 days
  ///                ago if you do not include this parameter.
  ///
  /// - [endTime]: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). Used with
  ///              `startTime`. The newest, most recent UTC timestamp to which
  ///              the Tweets will be provided. Timestamp is in second
  ///              granularity and is exclusive (for example, 12:00:01 excludes
  ///              the first second of the minute). If used without `startTime`,
  ///              Tweets from 30 days before `endTime` will be returned by
  ///              default. If not specified, `endTime` will default to
  ///              [now - 30 seconds].
  ///
  /// - [sinceTweetId]: Returns results with a Tweet ID greater than
  ///                   (that is, more recent than) the specified 'since'
  ///                   Tweet ID. Only the 3200 most recent Tweets are
  ///                   available. The result will exclude the since_id. If the
  ///                   limit of Tweets has occurred since the [sinceTweetId],
  ///                   the [sinceTweetId] will be forced to the oldest ID
  ///                   available.
  ///
  /// - [untilTweetId]: Returns results with a Tweet ID less than
  ///                   (that is, older than) the specified 'until' Tweet ID.
  ///                   Only the 3200 most recent Tweets are available. The
  ///                   result will exclude the until_id. If the limit of
  ///                   Tweets has occurred since the [untilTweetId], the
  ///                   [untilTweetId]  will be forced to the most recent ID
  ///                   available.
  ///
  /// - [excludes]: The list of the types of Tweets to exclude from the
  ///               response. When exclude=retweets is used, the maximum
  ///               historical Tweets returned is still 3200. When the
  ///               exclude=replies parameter is used for any value, only the
  ///               most recent 800 Tweets are available.
  ///
  /// - [expansions]: Expansions enable you to request additional data objects
  ///                 that relate to the originally returned Tweets. Submit a
  ///                 list of desired expansions in a comma-separated list
  ///                 without spaces. The ID that represents the expanded data
  ///                 object will be included directly in the Tweet data object,
  ///                 but the expanded object metadata will be returned within
  ///                 the includes response object, and will also include the
  ///                 ID so that you can match this data object to the original
  ///                 Tweet object.
  ///
  /// - [tweetFields]: This fields parameter enables you to select which
  ///                  specific Tweet fields will deliver in each returned Tweet
  ///                  object. You can also pass `expansions` to return the

  ///                  will display in both the original Tweet data object, as
  ///                  well as in the referenced Tweet expanded data object that
  ///                  will be located in the `includes` data object.
  ///
  /// - [userFields]: This fields parameter enables you to select which specific
  ///                 user fields will deliver in each returned Tweet. While the
  ///                 user ID will be located in the original Tweet object, you
  ///                 will find this ID and all additional user fields in the
  ///                 `includes` data object.
  ///
  /// - [placeFields]: This fields parameter enables you to select which
  ///                  specific place fields will deliver in each returned
  ///                  Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated
  ///                  list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet
  ///                  will only return place fields if the Tweet contains a
  ///                  place and if you’ve also included the
  ///                  `expansions=geo.place_id` query parameter in your
  ///                  request. While the place ID will be located in the Tweet
  ///                  object, you will find this ID and all additional place
  ///                  fields in the `includes` data object.
  ///
  /// - [pollFields]: This fields parameter enables you to select which specific
  ///                 poll fields will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify
  ///                 the desired fields in a comma-separated list without
  ///                 spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet will only
  ///                 return poll fields if the Tweet contains a poll and if
  ///                 you've also included the `expansions=attachments.poll_ids`
  ///                 query parameter in your request. While the poll ID will be
  ///                 located in the Tweet object, you will find this ID and all
  ///                 additional poll fields in the `includes` data object.
  ///
  /// - [mediaFields]: This fields parameter enables you to select which
  ///                  specific media fields will deliver in each returned
  ///                  Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated
  ///                  list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet
  ///                  will only return media fields if the Tweet contains media
  ///                  and if you've also included the
  ///                  `expansions=attachments.media_keys` query parameter in
  ///                  your request. While the media ID will be located in the
